# Gesture-Control-for-Robots---Major-Project

This project is about creating a program that allows a camera attached to a robot detect the gestures of a human being
and use them to send commands to the robot and therefore allow the human to control the robot by gesturing at it.


Important notes for doing stuff with terminals in the delph:
open terminal in 1 Major Project
	cd 1 then tab to get 1 Major Project


g++ -o simulator `pkg-config --cflags playerc++` simple.cpp `pkg-config--libs playerc++`

g++ -o simulator `pkg-config --cflags playerc` RobotControl.py `pkg-config--libs playerc`



type "player ./simple.cfg" - this opens stage
